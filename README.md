Program - 2

Create black and white images (A) of size 1024x1024. Which consists of alternative horizontal lines of 
black and white? Each line is of size 128. Create black and white images (B) of size 1024x1024. Which 
consists of alternative vertical lines of black and white? Each line is of size128.Perform the following 
operations on Image A and Image B. 
a. Image addition of A and B 
b. Subtraction of A and B 
c. Multiplying Images of A and B 
d. Create a grayscale image of size 256x1024. Intensity of image should vary 
sinusoidal. 
e. Create a white image of size 256x256, with black box of size 58x58 at centre. 

Program - 3

Computation of mean, Standard Deviation, Correlation coefficient of the given Image.

Program - 4

Image interpolation in python

Program - 5

Develop programs for following intensity transformation operation on a gray scale image. Collect any 
gray scale image from any source. Process that image using these operations. 
a. Image negative 
b. Log transformation and inverse log transform: s = c log (1+r), c is a const, r â‰¥ 0. s 
is pixel intensity of output image, r is the pixel intensity of input image. Study the 
effect of constant c on the quality of output image. 
c. Power law transformation: Study the effect of different values of Gamma used in 
this transformation. 
d. Contrast stretching 
e. Gray level slicing
